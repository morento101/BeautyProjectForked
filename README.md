# Beauty project

Our project was created in order to bring customers closer to the service providers of the beauty industry.    
We are trying to improve the interaction of the main participants in these processes. The client is provided with a tool for convenient registration for the services of a hairdresser, barber and other specialists. Specialists get the opportunity to use their time more efficiently. And the owners of beauty salons will be able to attract new customers and monitor the workload of their specialists.

## Using flake8

- Install flake8 according to python version:

```
python3.9 -m pip install flake8
```

- Install flake8 extensions:

```
pip instll -r requirements-flake8.txt
```

- Install pre-commit:

``` 
pip install pre-commit
```

- Make sure there are files `.flake8` & `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the project 
directory

- Create hook:

```
pre-commit install
```

- Settings are ready to use. Before committing, the hook will run 
a flake8 check. If the check does not pass the commit will not take place.
